#2:📈 Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data

This project focuses on **extracting, analyzing, and visualizing stock and revenue data** for major companies using Python.  
By combining APIs, web scraping, and data visualization, this project demonstrates how data-driven insights can support investment and business decisions.

## 🧠 Project Description
Extracting essential data from financial sources and displaying it clearly is a key part of data science.  
In this project, we:
- Extract real-world stock price data using the **yfinance** API  
- Scrape revenue data from online sources using **BeautifulSoup**
- Visualize both stock trends and revenue performance over time

The companies analyzed in this project are:
- **Tesla (TSLA)**
- **GameStop (GME)**

## 🧩 Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3**
- **yfinance** – to extract historical stock data  
- **BeautifulSoup (bs4)** – for web scraping company revenue  
- **pandas** – for data cleaning and manipulation  
- **matplotlib** – for plotting stock and revenue data  
- **requests** – to access web data
